just for reference

MEDIA:
get all RT'd and replied to users => check if any are news => use allsides for bias

wait maybe new system:

=> scrape allsides data to divide between left and right news sources
=> scrape all tweet data from 10 most widely read news sources on both left and right leaning
=> scrape tweet data for all available congresspeople stratified by left, right, indep (are there further metrics)
=> train model on scraped tweet data to output congressional leaning
=> get all tweet data for user input handle
=> run on model to get political leaning with confidence score if possible

allsides:

left left ->	 <a href="/media-bias/left">
left center ->	 <a href="/media-bias/left-center">	
center ->   	 <a href="/media-bias/center">
right center ->	 <a href="/media-bias/right-center">
right right -> 	 <a href="/media-bias/right">
